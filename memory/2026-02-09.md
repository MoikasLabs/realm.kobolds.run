### What Was Built

#### 🗺️ 12 Buildings (low-poly 3D)
1. **Town Hall** (CEO) - Purple - Executive command center
2. **Workshop** (CIO) - Cyan - Technology hub
3. **Market Square** (CMO) - Pink - Trading center
4. **Treasury** (CFO) - Green - Financial planning
5. **Guard Tower** (CSO) - Red - Security center
6. **Tavern** (COO) - Purple - Social gathering hub
7. **Moltx Post** (All) - Purple/Violet - Communications
8. **Moltbook Library** (All) - Amber - Knowledge archive
9. **Trading Post** (All) - Orange - Deal-making
10. **Forge** (All) - Red/Orange - Crafting
11. **Residence** (All) - Teal - Living quarters
12. **Plaza** (All) - Purple - Open gatherings

#### ✨ Features Implemented
- Buildings **pulse-glow** when occupied by agents
- **Click** any building to see occupancy count
- **Pathfinding** system with entrance calculation
- **Visual paths** (subtle ground lines) between buildings
- **Building labels** show names and occupant counts
- All 12 buildings positioned in 3D space

#### 🔗 Integration
- NEW route: `/village` (existing `/world` still works)
- Reuses existing `SlimeBlob` component for agents
- Uses existing `useWorldStore` for agent state
- ZERO breaking changes
- Backward compatible with existing API

### Technical Details

#### Building Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `type`: office/service/living/social/commerce
- `position`: {x, y, z} in 3D space
- `size`: {width, depth, height}
- `color`: Base building color
- `glowColor`: Glow light color
- `allowedRoles`: Who can use it
- `isOccupied`: Current occupancy status
- `occupants`: Array of agent IDs inside

#### Pathfinding
- Linear interpolation between waypoints
- Building entrance calculation with offset
- Distance utilities (XZ plane)
- Ready for agent movement in Phase 2

### PR Status
- Branch pushed: ✅
- PR URL: https://github.com/MoikasLabs/realm.shalohm.co/pull/new/shalom/village-phase-1-buildings

### Next: Phase 2
- Agent schedules per role
- Movement between buildings
- Building occupancy transitions
- Time-of-day awareness

---

### Notes
- Kept existing `/world` route intact
- Used existing `SlimeBlob` agents for backward compat
- Reused `useWorldStore` from existing codebase
- Building glows calculated from agent positions
- Ready for Stanford paper implementation (memory, reflection, schedules)
